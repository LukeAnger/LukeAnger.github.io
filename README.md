  <h2> How to Set Up Your Github Pages Repo and Website </h2>
  
  <h3>-- Step 1 --</h3>
  Create a repo with the following name format {your_github_handle}.github.io.
  
  For example, my github handle is LukeAnger, so as you can see this repo is named LukeAnger.github.io.
  
  
  <h3>-- Step 2 --</h3>
  Go to the settings page for the repo and click on the "Pages" tab in the "Code and automation" section. Under "Build and deployment you should see a "Source" dropdown menu where you will select "Deploy from a branch" then under "Branch" you should ensure the branch is set to main (unless you have created a new branch then you can deploy from a specific branch".
  
  <h3>-- Step 3 --</h3>
  Inside that repo you can create an index.html file and a styles.css file in whatever way you know how or copy the way I have set mine up.
  
  <h3>-- Step 4 --</h3>
  Ensure the repo is public if you are on a free github account and after saving/committing/pushing any changes you have made, wait a couple minutes and your github page should be updated and you can view it at the following url {your_github_handle}.github.io .
